mvn clean && mvn tests
```

## Runtime requeriments

### Start volatile storage locally

```bash
cd infrastructure/spring-boot
mvn -Dtests.db.database=ecomm_users pre-integration-test
```

### Run application
```bash
./run.sh
```

### Debug application on port 5005
```bash
./debug.sh
```

## Swagger UI

## Run application from IDE

This application uses S3Client from AWS SDK v2 because it needs to reach S3 and get a signed upload URL when a user wants to upload an avatar. So when it run locally and AWS credentials are not available, it's possible connect to localstack which is running as part as `local volatile storage`.

For that, the following environment variables must be defined in the IDE launcher
```
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test
AWS_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4566
```


## Check message on a Kafka topic

It's possible to jump into kafka server using ssh, or connect to the container if it is running in a docker container,
and the following command will allow you to see the message which are generated by this service on topic "users-entities-update-topic"

```bash
/bin/kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --from-beginning --topic users-entities-update-topic
```
